These donations will help us achieve our goal of getting the Transparent Restaurant Pricing Act on the ballot. More specifically, they will fund things like hosting this website, printing costs, professional services to ensure compliance with relevant election and campaign-finance laws, and (if budget allows) advertisements and paid signature gathering.

Note that we do not use this as a mailing list and will never spam you using the info from this form. Donorbox will send you a receipt and an offer to create an account to manage donations. If you want updates, please [separately subscribe to our email list](/subscribe)
