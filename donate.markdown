Donations of any size can be made online, and all donations are greatly appreciated. However, if you plan to make a large donation, please reach out to us via email at <a href="mailto:contact@sfclearprices.org">contact@sfclearprices.org</a> so we can work to avoid excessive transaction fees.

These donations will help us achieve our goal of getting the Transparent Restaurant Pricing Act on the ballot. More specifically, they will fund things like hosting this website, printing costs, professional services to ensure compliance with relevant election and campaign-finance laws, and (if budget allows) advertisements and paid signature gathering.
