# How YOU can help us ban junk fees 

### [Sign](/sign)

### Volunteer as a petition circulator

To ciculate the petition, the sole qualification is that **you must be at least 18 years old**. (People who live elsewhere in the Bay, this is your chance to help!)

This is probably the **single best thing you can do to help**.

If we’re going to reach our goal of 15,000 signatures, we'll need a lot of circulators.
If you’ve never circulated a petition before, don’t worry! We can teach everything you need to know.
Even if you’re not comfortable awkwardly approaching strangers to ask, you can just casually circulate among people you already know! Show your work friends. Bring your clipboard along to a party (that’s not too weird is it?). Talk to your friends in the city; every signature helps!
If you want to volunteer, the first thing you'll need to do is attend a session to learn how to circulate and receive petition sections. You can do that by attending
events listed [here](/sign).

The first think you'll need to do is find us to pick up petition sections! You can do that at any event tagged "petition pickup."
If nothing here works for you, reach out to [reach out to us to arrange a pickup](/contact)!
