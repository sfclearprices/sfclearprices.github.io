# How YOU can help us ban junk fees 

### Sign the petition

To sign, you must be registered to vote in San Francisco.

* [Check your registration status](https://voterstatus.sos.ca.gov/)
* [Register to vote](https://registertovote.ca.gov/)

San Francisco's initiative process hasn't exactly made it to the 21st century yet, so you'll need to find someone in person to sign a paper copy of the petition.
You can find us at these events! However, if you want to sign and can't make it, please [reach out to us](/contact) to see if we can work out a way to get the petition in front of you.

* Dolores Park, 11am-1pm on Saturday, March 1, 2025
* Marina Green, 2pm-4pm on Saturday, March 1, 2025
* Inner Sunset (9th/Irving), 11am-1pm on Sunday, March 2, 2025
* Washington Square Park, 2pm-4pm on Sunday, March 2, 2025

(More events and RSVP system to come, check back on this page)

### Volunteer as a petition circulator

To ciculate the petition, the sole qualification is that **you must be at least 18 years old**. (People who live elsewhere in the Bay, this is your chance to help!)

This is probably the **single best thing you can do to help**.

If we’re going to reach our goal of 15,000 signatures, we'll need a lot of circulators.
If you’ve never circulated a petition before, don’t worry! We can teach everything you need to know.
Even if you’re not comfortable awkwardly approaching strangers to ask, you can just casually circulate among people you already know! Show your work friends. Bring your clipboard along to a party (that’s not too weird is it?). Talk to your friends in the city; every signature helps!
If you want to volunteer, the first thing you'll need to do is attend a session to learn how to circulate and receive petition sections. You can do that by attending
events listed <!-- marked "circulator training" --> above.

We also ask that you first [fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfYfI1zvqL-lbQXN1btLw2u3j0MgCI4UGLqZEvSH-iiRin6xg/viewform?usp=header) so we know who you are.
You can fill it out here or just drop in, but please fill out in advance if you can so we can guarantee that we have enough supplies.

If you want to get ahead, you can also read our ["Hitchhiker’s Guide to Circulating a Petition in San Francisco"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YkOkqOgwv39OfEZygB8f8RJuACUxyqk9E85v2wvC7oY) training document
