# 3 ways to sign

## 1. Print at home

San Francisco's process hasn't exactly entered the 21st century, so there is no online signature option.

<a href="/SelfServicePetition.pdf" style="display: inline-block; padding: 10px 20px; font-size: 18px; color: #fff; background-color: #28a745; border: none; border-radius: 5px; text-align: center;">Download the Petition PDF</a>

The [petition](/SelfServicePetition.pdf) MUST be printed at 100% size on standard US letter paper, and all enclosed instructions must be followed, or City Hall may not count your signature.

Also note that if you do not have a printer, [the library offers $2 daily in free printing](https://sfpl.libanswers.com/faq/341987) to anyone with a library card.

## 2. Attend an in-person event

View a list of in-person events [here](/volunteer), or post on [our subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SFClearPrices/)
to reach out to volunteers.

## 3. Request a copy of the petition by mail

If you do not have access to a printer, fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSciaBs7ypYjnsN0P8pUJnhOeyKut8n2xYQT1sNu4omBMAUvZQ/viewform?usp=header) to request a copy by mail.

We will enclose a return envelope; all you need is a pen.
