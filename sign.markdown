# Three ways to sign

To sign, you must be registered to vote in San Francisco.

* [Check your registration status](https://voterstatus.sos.ca.gov/)
* [Register to vote](https://registertovote.ca.gov/)

## 1. Print at home

San Francisco's process hasn't exactly entered the 21st century, so there is no online signature option. This is as close
as we can get.

<a href="/SelfServicePetition.pdf" style="display: inline-block; padding: 10px 20px; font-size: 18px; color: #fff; background-color: #28a745; border: none; border-radius: 5px; text-align: center;">Download the Petition PDF</a>

The [petition](/SelfServicePetition.pdf) MUST be printed at 100% size on standard US letter paper, and all enclosed instructions must be followed, or City Hall may not count your signature.

Also note that if you do not have a printer, [the library offers $2 daily in free printing](https://sfpl.libanswers.com/faq/341987) to anyone with a library card.

## 2. Attend an in-person event

We will be collecting signatures here:

* Dolores Park, 11am-1pm on Saturday, March 1, 2025
* Marina Green, 2pm-4pm on Saturday, March 1, 2025
* Inner Sunset (9th/Irving), 11am-1pm on Sunday, March 2, 2025
* Washington Square Park, 2pm-4pm on Sunday, March 2, 2025

(This page will be updated with more dates over time.)

You can also post on [our subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SFClearPrices/)
or [reach out to us](/contact) to suggest additional locations or events.

## 3. Request a copy of the petition by mail

If you do not have access to a printer, fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSciaBs7ypYjnsN0P8pUJnhOeyKut8n2xYQT1sNu4omBMAUvZQ/viewform?usp=header) to request a copy by mail.

We will enclose a return envelope; all you need is a pen.
